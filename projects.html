            <p>
              After completing my first functional project, a weather app, I was eager to continue expanding my coding skills. The next project I embarked on was creating a world-clock app.

The world-clock app allowed users to easily check the time in different cities around the globe. It was designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing. I wanted to create an app that would not only serve a practical purpose but also provide an enjoyable user experience.

To begin with, I researched different time zones and their corresponding cities. This involved understanding how time zones work and how they are represented in code. Once I had gathered all the necessary information, I started coding the app.

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the world-clock app. HTML provided the structure of the page while CSS helped me style it according to my vision. JavaScript played a crucial role in making the app functional by allowing users to select different cities and displaying their respective times.

Throughout this project, I encountered various challenges such as handling time zone conversions accurately and ensuring that the interface was intuitive for users. However, with perseverance and problem-solving skills, I managed to overcome these obstacles.

Creating a world-clock app on SheCodes not only enhanced my coding abilities but also taught me valuable lessons about research, problem-solving, and user experience design. It solidified my passion for coding and motivated me to continue exploring new projects and expanding my skill set further.

              Embarking on the Shecodes Plus program was an exciting and challenging journey for me. One of the most memorable moments during this course was when I completed my first functional project, a weather app. This experience not only solidified my understanding of coding concepts but also boosted my confidence as a developer.
            Creating this weather app allowed me to apply the skills I had learned in a practical way. I had to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design an intuitive user interface and fetch real-time weather data from an API. It was thrilling to see my code come alive as the app displayed accurate weather information based on user input.
             Throughout the development process, I encountered various obstacles that tested my problem-solving abilities. From debugging errors to implementing responsive design, each challenge pushed me to think critically and find creative solutions. With the guidance of the Shecodes instructors and support from fellow students, I overcame these hurdles and successfully completed my first functional project.
            This project taught me valuable lessons about perseverance and attention to detail. Small mistakes in syntax or logic could lead to significant issues in functionality. Therefore, I learned how important it is to carefully review code and test thoroughly before considering a project complete. 
            Creating this weather app was a pivotal moment in my coding journey. It marked a turning point where theory transformed into practice, enabling me to build something tangible with my newfound skills. The sense of accomplishment I felt upon completing this project has motivated me to continue learning and exploring new possibilities in web development.

            <p>
              Out of passion for my city, Bulawayo, I have taken it upon myself to develop a page that showcases its beauty, history, and culture. Bulawayo is a city rich in heritage and diversity, yet often overlooked by tourists and even some locals. Through this page, I aim to change that perception and bring attention to the hidden gems that lie within.

              One cannot talk about Bulawayo without mentioning its fascinating history. Founded in 1894 during the colonial era, the city has witnessed significant events that have shaped its identity. From being the industrial hub of Zimbabwe to serving as a center for arts and culture, Bulawayo has played a pivotal role in the country's development.
              
              Moreover, Bulawayo is home to numerous architectural marvels such as the iconic Natural History Museum and the stunning Railway Museum. These landmarks not only showcase the city's historical significance but also serve as reminders of its grandeur.
              
              Additionally, my page will highlight the vibrant cultural scene in Bulawayo. The city boasts an array of traditional festivals, art exhibitions, and music performances that celebrate its diverse population. By promoting these events on my page, I hope to attract both locals and tourists who are interested in immersing themselves in our unique cultural tapestry.
              
              Through my passion-driven initiative of developing a page for my beloved city Bulawayo, I aim to shed light on its rich history and vibrant culture. By showcasing its hidden treasures and promoting local events, I hope to inspire others to explore this remarkable city and appreciate all it has to offer.
